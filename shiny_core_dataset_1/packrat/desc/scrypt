Description: Functions for working with the scrypt key derivation functions
    originally described by Colin Percival
    <https://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt/scrypt.pdf> and in Percival and Josefsson
    (2016) <doi:10.17487/RFC7914>. Scrypt is a password-based key derivation
    function created by Colin Percival. The algorithm was specifically designed
    to make it costly to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks by
    requiring large amounts of memory.
